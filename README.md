# Microservices Project
In this project, a microservice application consisting of the following simple services was implemented.
- [Platform Service](https://github.com/akorez/MicroService_Project/tree/master/PlatformService)
- [Command Service ](https://github.com/akorez/MicroService_Project/tree/master/CommandsService)

The aim of the project is to implement real-life MicroServices concepts with examples, rather than implementing an end-to-end Microservices application with frontend and backend. 
For an end-to-end microservices application, you can check out my [Udemy Clone](https://github.com/akorez/Udemy-Clone) repo!
